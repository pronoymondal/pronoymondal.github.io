<h1>Short Bio</h1>
  <p> I have grown up and been educated at India. </p>
  <p> During my undergraduate, I decided to be a researcher. In spite of all obstacles and hurdles, partly due to cultural pressure 
    in India, I have never given up on my given up my passion. I became interested to work on Biostatistics after I worked on a summer project with
  Prof. Indranil Mukhopdhyay in 2012. People around me including my teachers always advised me to pursue research on Theoretical Statistics. My inside liking 
  brought me to the field of Comuputational Biology from Statistics.</p>
  <p> Other than academics, I am also an enthusiastic trekker, Ukulele player, and a cricketer. I read a lot of Buddhist and Confucian philosophy books.</p>
