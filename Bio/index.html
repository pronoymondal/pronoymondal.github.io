<h1>Short Bio</h1>
  <p> I have grown up and been educated at India. </p>
  <p> During my undergraduate, I decided to be a researcher. In spite of all obstacles and hurdles, partly due to cultural pressure 
    in India, I have never given up on my passion. I became interested in Biostatistics after I worked on a summer project with
  Prof. Indranil Mukhopdhyay in 2012. People around me including my teachers always advised me to pursue research on Theoretical Statistics. My liking for the subject 
  brought me to the field of Comuputational Biology from Statistics.</p>
  <p> Other than academics, I am also an enthusiastic trekker, Ukulele player, Ches player, Badminton player and a cricketer. 
    During my leisure, I watch Netflix TV series or read story books.</p>
